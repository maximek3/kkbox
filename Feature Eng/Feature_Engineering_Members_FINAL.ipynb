As such, the value in \"city\" has no actual numerical meaning. In this case, it is used to describe the city in which the user lives. Alternatively, the cities could also have been designated by their actual name, or a different categorical value, such as \"A\", \"B\", etc. Summing up the values would make no sense. In addition, a city containg a high value does not have a higher importance. Before we handle information about the city to the algorithm, we need to binarize it.\n",

As a result, hot-encoding will generate 21 columns containing only 1's and 0's. If a costumer lives in city 3 for example, only the newly generated column \"city_3\" will contain a 1, while the other 20 columns contain a 0."

We showed in the data exploration that the chance of churning is higher for short-term users. We are going to consider the dates until the year 2012. This is due to the fact that we don't have a lot of data on the years before 2011. Adding these years as well will only make our algorithm slow and we unwanted noise is generated.

    "Next, we need to one-hot encode the registration method. Similarly to the \"city\"-variable, this feature contains integer values that have no numerical meaning. The algorithm will not be able to understand that the value in \"registered_via\" has no actual meaning. The algorithm will add a higher weight to high values, which would be wrong. This is why we need to one-hot encode the regisration method as well. Taking the data exploration into account, we decide to get rid of certain values for \"registration_via\" as they only represent a very small fraction of the data. As such, they are not relevant and will make the algorithm slow and inefficient."

    "The age of the users also plays a role in the likelihood of churning, as it was mentioned in the data exploration. In a first step, we get rid of the outliers, by setting al the values that are smaller than one and larger than 90 to 24. 24 corresponds to the median We just assume that a user is between 1 and 90 years old. Next we normalize the data (min-max normalization). The data is normalized, because the range of the values for our raw data varies widely between different features. To prevent a bad effect on the performance of the algorithm, we take the precautionary step to normalize it. In fact, some objective functions will not work properly if data is not normalized.\n"

While merging the files together, NULL values may be generated, because we use a left merge on the \"train\", \"train_v2\" and \"submission\" dataframe respectivaly. They may contain msno's that cannot be found in the \"members\"-file, and as such, NULL values in the corresponding rows are generated.\n",

For the birthdays, we chose to set them to 0.26 (normalized representation of 24), because 24 represents a high-frquency value for the birthdays (this can be concluded by looking at the histogram in the data exploration section)"
